# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring the **Requirement Analysis** phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It provides documentation, examples, and visual representations of key activities such as requirement gathering, elicitation, documentation, analysis, and validation. The goal is to create a clear blueprint for developing a booking management system and to demonstrate industry-standard practices in defining functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
