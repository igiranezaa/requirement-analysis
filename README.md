# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring the **Requirement Analysis** phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It provides documentation, examples, and visual representations of key activities such as requirement gathering, elicitation, documentation, analysis, and validation. The goal is to create a clear blueprint for developing a booking management system and to demonstrate industry-standard practices in defining functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, examines, and defines the requirements for a software system. The main goal of this phase is to ensure that all stakeholders—including clients, users, and developers—have a clear and shared understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis

1. **Clarity and Understanding:** It helps reduce misunderstandings by clearly defining what the stakeholders expect from the system.  
2. **Scope Definition:** Establishes the boundaries of the project, helping prevent scope creep.  
3. **Foundation for Design and Development:** Provides a solid basis for creating system designs and writing code.  
4. **Cost and Time Estimation:** Facilitates accurate planning for resources, budget, and project timelines.  
5. **Quality Assurance:** Ensures the final product meets the defined requirements, improving user satisfaction and reducing post-deployment issues.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial step in the SDLC because it ensures that software development proceeds efficiently and meets user expectations. Here are three key reasons why it is important:

1. **Clear Understanding of Stakeholder Needs:**  
   Requirement Analysis helps the team understand exactly what stakeholders expect from the software. This reduces ambiguity and ensures everyone is aligned on project goals.

2. **Prevents Scope Creep:**  
   By defining the project’s scope early, Requirement Analysis helps avoid unnecessary additions or changes during development, keeping the project on track in terms of time and cost.

3. **Foundation for Design and Development:**  
   Well-documented requirements provide a solid base for creating system designs, writing code, and planning tests, which ultimately leads to higher quality software and satisfied users.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several important activities to ensure that the software meets stakeholders' needs. The five key activities are:

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations. Techniques include interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and reviewing existing documentation.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Refining and elaborating on the gathered information. Methods include brainstorming sessions, focus groups, and creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Recording requirements in a clear, structured format. This includes writing requirement specification documents, user stories, and use case diagrams for functional and non-functional requirements.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  Examining and prioritizing requirements based on importance and feasibility. This step may involve creating models like data flow diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams to better understand the system.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Reviewing documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness. This includes defining acceptance criteria and maintaining traceability to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.
