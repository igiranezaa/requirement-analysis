# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring the **Requirement Analysis** phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It provides documentation, examples, and visual representations of key activities such as requirement gathering, elicitation, documentation, analysis, and validation. The goal is to create a clear blueprint for developing a booking management system and to demonstrate industry-standard practices in defining functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, examines, and defines the requirements for a software system. The main goal of this phase is to ensure that all stakeholders—including clients, users, and developers—have a clear and shared understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis

1. **Clarity and Understanding:** It helps reduce misunderstandings by clearly defining what the stakeholders expect from the system.  
2. **Scope Definition:** Establishes the boundaries of the project, helping prevent scope creep.  
3. **Foundation for Design and Development:** Provides a solid basis for creating system designs and writing code.  
4. **Cost and Time Estimation:** Facilitates accurate planning for resources, budget, and project timelines.  
5. **Quality Assurance:** Ensures the final product meets the defined requirements, improving user satisfaction and reducing post-deployment issues.
